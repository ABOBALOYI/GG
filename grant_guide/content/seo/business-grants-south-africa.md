## Grants vs Loans vs Equity: What is the Difference?

| Type | Repayment | Ownership | Best For |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Grant** | No repayment required | You keep 100% ownership | Startups, expansion projects, specific sectors |
| **Loan** | Must repay with interest | You keep 100% ownership | Working capital, equipment, property |
| **Equity** | No repayment | Investor takes ownership share | High-growth startups, scale-ups |

**Grants** are the most sought-after because they do not need to be repaid. However, they are competitive and often have strict reporting requirements.

**Loans** from development finance institutions like SEFA and IDC often have lower interest rates than commercial banks and more flexible terms for SMEs.

**Equity funding** means giving up a percentage of your business in exchange for capital. This is common for tech startups and high-growth ventures.

## Step-by-Step: How to Apply Successfully

1. **Research funding options**
   Search Grant Guide SA to find programmes that match your business type, size, and location. Do not apply for funding you do not qualify for.

2. **Check eligibility requirements**
   Read the full criteria on the funder's official website. Note deadlines, required documents, and any exclusions.

4. **Gather all required documents**
   Missing documents are the top reason applications are rejected. Use the checklist above.

5. **Complete the application form**
   Fill in all sections accurately. Do not exaggerate figures or make false claims.

   Many programmes have fixed closing dates. Late applications are not considered.

   If the funder requests additional information, respond quickly. Keep records of all communication.

## FAQs

**Can I get a business grant if my business is not registered?**
Most government grants require CIPC registration. However, some programmes like NYDA vouchers may assist with registration first. Informal businesses should consider registering to access more funding options.

**Do I need B-BBEE certification to apply for grants?**
Not always. B-BBEE is required for some government programmes, especially larger contracts and incentives. Many SME grants accept a B-BBEE affidavit instead of a full certificate. Check each programme's requirements.

**Do grants need to be repaid?**
No. Grants are non-repayable funding. However, you must use the funds for the stated purpose and may need to submit progress reports. Misuse of grant funds can result in legal action.

**How long does it take to get approved for funding?**
Timelines vary. Simple grants may take 4-8 weeks. Larger loans and incentives can take 3-6 months. Always apply early and have backup plans.

**Can I apply for multiple grants at the same time?**
Yes, you can apply to different funders for different purposes. However, you cannot use multiple grants for the same expense. Be transparent about other funding you have received or applied for.

**Are there grants specifically for women-owned businesses?**
Yes. SEFA, NEF, and several provincial agencies have dedicated programmes for women entrepreneurs. The dtic also has incentives for women in manufacturing and export.

**What is the difference between SEFA and IDC?**
SEFA focuses on small and micro enterprises with loans from R50,000. IDC targets larger industrial projects with minimum funding of R1 million. Both are development finance institutions.

**Can township or informal businesses get funding?**
Yes. Programmes like NYDA, GEP, and some provincial agencies specifically target township enterprises. You may need to formalise your business first.
