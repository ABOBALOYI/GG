## Grants vs Loans vs Stokvels: What is the Difference?

| Type | Repayment | Typical Amounts | Best For |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Grant** | No repayment | R1,000 - R100,000 | Equipment, stock, training |
| **Loan** | Must repay with interest | R5,000 - R5 million | Working capital, expansion |
| **Stokvel/Savings Group** | Rotating contributions | R500 - R50,000 | Quick access, no paperwork |
| **Supplier Credit** | Pay later for stock | Varies | Stock purchases |

For many township entrepreneurs, starting with a stokvel or small grant, then graduating to formal loans as the business grows, is a practical pathway.

## Step-by-Step: How to Apply Successfully

1. **Assess your current status**
   Are you informal or registered? This determines which programmes you can access. Consider registering to unlock more options.

2. **Start with free support**
   Visit NYDA, GEP, or your provincial agency for free business advice. They can help you understand your options and prepare applications.

3. **Get your documents in order**
   Even informal businesses should keep records. Track your sales, expenses, and customers.

4. **Apply for appropriate funding**
   Do not apply for R1 million if you need R10,000. Match the funding to your actual needs and business stage.

5. **Be honest in your application**
   Do not exaggerate your turnover or experience. Funders verify information.

6. **Follow up regularly**
   Check on your application status. Respond quickly to any requests.

7. **Use funds as intended**
   If approved, use the money for what you said you would. Funders may check, and misuse affects future applications.
