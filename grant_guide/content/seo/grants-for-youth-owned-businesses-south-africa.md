**Ownership Requirements:**

## Grants vs Loans vs Equity: What is the Difference?

| Type | Repayment | Best For Youth |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Grant** | No repayment | Starting a business, equipment, training |
| **Loan** | Must repay with interest | Working capital, expansion, larger amounts |
| **Equity** | Give up ownership share | Tech startups, high-growth ventures |

For most young entrepreneurs starting out, grants are ideal because you do not need to repay them. However, grant amounts are often limited (R50,000-R100,000), so loans may be needed for larger projects.

## Step-by-Step: How to Apply Successfully

1. **Confirm your eligibility**
   Check that you meet the age requirement (18-35) and ownership threshold (51% youth-owned). Read the full criteria for your chosen programme.

2. **Register your business**
   If not already registered, complete CIPC registration first. NYDA vouchers can help with this step.

3. **Develop a solid business plan**
   Explain what your business does, who your customers are, how you will make money, and what you need the funding for. Be realistic with your numbers.

4. **Gather all documents**
   Use the checklist above. Missing documents delay or disqualify applications.

5. **Apply through official channels**
   For NYDA, apply online at nyda.gov.za or visit a local branch. For SEFA, apply at sefa.org.za. Do not pay anyone to submit your application.

6. **Attend interviews or assessments**
   Many programmes require you to present your business idea. Prepare to answer questions about your market, competition, and financial projections.

7. **Follow up professionally**
   Check your application status regularly. Respond quickly to any requests for additional information.
