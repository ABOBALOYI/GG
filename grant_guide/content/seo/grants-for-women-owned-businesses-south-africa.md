## FAQs

**What percentage of ownership qualifies as women-owned?**
Most programmes require at least 51% ownership by women. Some programmes require women to also hold executive management positions, not just be shareholders.

**Can men be involved in a women-owned business?**
Yes. Men can be minority shareholders (up to 49%) and employees. However, women must hold majority ownership and be actively involved in management.

**Is there funding specifically for black women entrepreneurs?**
Yes. The NEF Women Empowerment Fund specifically targets black women-owned businesses. Many other programmes prioritise black women as part of B-BBEE objectives.

**Do I need B-BBEE certification?**
Not always, but it helps. Many government programmes require B-BBEE compliance. A sworn affidavit may be accepted for smaller businesses instead of a full certificate.

**How much funding can women-owned businesses get?**
Amounts range from R30,000 (Isivande Women's Fund minimum) to R75 million (NEF maximum). The amount depends on your business size, sector, and funding needs.

**Are there grants that do not need to be repaid?**
Yes, but they are limited. Most women-specific funding is in the form of loans with favourable terms. The dtic incentives and some provincial programmes offer non-repayable grants.

**Can I apply if I am a sole proprietor?**
Some programmes accept sole proprietors, but most prefer registered companies (Pty Ltd) or cooperatives. Consider registering a company to access more funding options.

Yes. Many programmes prioritise rural women entrepreneurs. Provincial agencies often have specific rural enterprise programmes.
